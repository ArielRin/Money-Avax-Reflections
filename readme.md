# Money Avax Rewards Token 

## Project Overview

Welcome to the official readme for our MoneyAvaxRewrds Token contract! This document aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of our tokenomics and the features that make our token unique.

### Tokenomics

- **Total Supply:** 1 Quadrillion Tokens
- **Decimals:** 9

### Distribution Mechanism

- **5% Reflections in Weth.e Token to Holders:** Holders of our token will receive a 5% reward in Weth.e tokens on every transaction. This means the longer you hold our token, the more reflections you accumulate over time.

- **2% to Liquidity Pool:** A portion of each transaction (2%) contributes to the liquidity pool, enhancing the stability and liquidity of the token on the market.

- **1% to Marketing:** We allocate 1% of each transaction to our marketing efforts. This fund supports activities that promote the token and enhance its visibility within the community and beyond.

## The Power of 5% Reflections

One of the key highlights of our token is the 5% reflections distributed to holders. Here's why this feature is awesome for the community:

### Passive Income

Holders are automatically rewarded with 5% reflections in Weth.e tokens, just by holding our token in their wallets. This creates a continuous stream of passive income for our community members, fostering a sense of financial empowerment.

### Community Engagement

The reflections mechanism incentivizes community members to hold onto their tokens, leading to increased engagement and loyalty. The longer you hold, the more reflections you accumulate, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between the project and its community.

### Value Appreciation

As reflections are distributed, the overall value of each token held by community members increases over time. This dynamic encourages long-term holding strategies, contributing to the overall stability and growth of the token.

### Transparent and Fair

The reflections distribution is automated and transparent, ensuring a fair distribution to all token holders. This feature aligns with our commitment to building a community-driven project with equitable benefits for all participants.
